                            Compiz Deskmenu

=== Requirements ===

 * A recent version of GLib 2.x and GTK+ 2.x
 * libwnck (2.20 is probably best, but not strictly required)
 * dbus (you must have a running session bus) and dbus-glib

It does not strictly require compiz (but it does need a recent version of the
vpswitch plugin for 'Initiate on Desktop' to work)

=== Install ===

 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Prefix support is currently broken, so it only works correctly if you install
to /usr (will be fixed when it gets a proper buildsystem or perhaps sooner)

=== Usage ===

For the lazy, you can run the provided "autoconfig-compiz.py" script (as your
user, *not* as root!), but here's what it sets:
 + General Options > Commands > Commands > Command line 0 to "compiz-deskmenu"
 + General Options > Commands > Key bindings > Run command 0 to "<Control>space"
 + Viewport Switcher > Desktop-based Viewport Switching > Plugin for initiate
   action to "core"
 + Viewport Switcher > Desktop-based Viewport Switching > Action name for
   initiate to "run_command0_key"

=== Menu Format ===

The default menu lives at /etc/xdg/compiz/deskmenu/menu.xml. You can override
that menu by copying it to ~/.config/compiz/deskmenu/menu.xml (it's XDG
basedir-compliant, so if you're setting those variables, adjust accordingly)

Menus: <menu title="Title"> Menus can contain <item> and more <menu> tags (so
  they're infinitely nestable!). The title attribute is optional and is ignored
  for the toplevel menu

Items: <item type="Type"> There are a few supported item types:
 * launcher: supports the following child elements:
    - <name>: the label to show in the menu
    - <icon>: the icon name to use in the menu.
      This name is looked up by gtk+, so you can toss custom icons in 
      ~/.icons/$YOUR_THEME/$ICON_SIZE/apps/
    - <command>: the launcher command line
 * separator: a simple GtkSeparatorMenuItem
 * windowlist: libwnck-based window list menu.
 * viewportlist: libwnck-based viewport list menu.
 * reload: reload button (it actually quits the daemon)
 * pipeitem: dynamically generated items based on script output (originally inspired by Openbox pipemenus)
 * documents: access to recent documents list

=== Implementation ===

It compiles into two binaries, compiz-deskmenu and compiz-deskmenu-daemon.
compiz-deskmenu is a simple dbus client that connects
to org.compiz_fusion.deskmenu and calls the show method. The actual menu is
compiz-deskmenu-daemon, but you shouldn't ever need to manually launch it; the
dbus service file will cause it to be automatically spawned when the name is
requested.
